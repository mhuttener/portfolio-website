                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>I started this project inspired to create a seamless and enjoyable experience for users when discovering and acquiring event tickets.</p>
                    <p>I recognized that the current process can often be frustrating and wanted to address the underlying issues that were causing this.</p>
                    <p>After conducting thorough research, I identified several key problems that were contributing to the poor user experience, such as limited payment options, inadequate customer support, and cumbersome login/sign-in procedures.</p>

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <h4>Goals</h4>
                    <p>Below are the areas I’d like to explore during the user research. I want to understand:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The patterns behind the event ticket purchasing process.</li>
                        <li>What are the user’s motivations behind attending specific events and purchasing tickets?</li>
                        <li>The context in which the users seek information on events and ticket details.</li>
                        <li>The user’s goals when using an event-location-based app for ticket acquisition, such as finding events with available tickets, comparing prices, and accessing tickets after purchase.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Methodologies</h4>
                    <p>Competitor research</p>
                    <p>I researched competitors such as Dice and TripAdvisor, and utilized user psychology techniques. I also conducted a SWOT analysis and evaluated UX for the project.</p>
                    <p>User research</p>
                    <p>I conducted user interviews to investigate the pain points, goals, response patterns, and noteworthy quotes from users when using an online platform to discover a new event.</p>
                    <p>User personas</p>
                    <p>To better understand user groups, I created fictional representations that captured the essence of their demographics, end goals, pain points, and quotes. These representations included scenarios that provided insight into the users' experiences.</p>

                    </picture>
                    <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                    <p>People who often attend events can use an event-based location app to find, organize, and get to events. This app helps them save time and effort by providing all the necessary information in one place.</p>
                    <h3>Research Synopsis</h3>
                    <p>I was surprised to learn that most of the users (even experienced event-goers) tend to make spontaneous decisions when it comes to attending events and purchasing tickets. </p>
                    <p>They are often influenced by external factors, such as social media ads, last-minute plans with friends, or stumbling upon an event while browsing event-location-based apps. </p>
                    <p>This led me to discover that what would help the users to set themselves up for long-term success, would be to provide them with better information and tools to make informed decisions before purchasing tickets, such as event details, location, price, and reviews.</p>

                <h3>Mid-fi Wireframes</h3>
                <p>The initial set of mid-fidelity wireframes enabled me to conduct early usability testing and identify the critical changes that must be made immediately.</p>
                <p>This approach reduced the number of iterations required for subsequent versions, allowing us to focus our efforts on developing a high-fidelity interface that delivers an outstanding user experience.</p>
                <h4>Task - JTBD 1</h4>
                <p>When I am looking for something to do, I want to quickly find events near me, so I can plan my day or night out.</p>

                <p>I tested the first version of the prototype with 5 users to determine the necessary revisions to make the overall experience more intuitive and pleasant. Here are some outtakes.</p>

                <p>Main pain points that were discovered during the tests and addressed in the iteration:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users had difficulties interpreting some of the prompts on the onboarding page. Fix: Simplified the registration process by reducing the number of required fields.</li>
                    <li>Users encountered instances where event information, such as dates, times, or locations, was inconsistent or missing, leading to confusion. Fix: Improved data consistency and accuracy.</li>
                    <li>Some users found the ticket selection process confusing or cumbersome, especially when events offered multiple ticket types. Fix: Provided clear and concise ticket descriptions.</li>

                <h3>Final Considerations</h3>
                <p>Throughout the project, I was responsible for both the UX and UI aspects. I conducted extensive research and rigorous testing to gather valuable insights and feedback.</p>
                <p>To decide on the MVP features and functionality, I started by understanding the project's goals and priorities. I identified the core objectives and needs of the users, and then assessed which features and functionality were essential to achieving those objectives. I prioritized those features based on their importance to the project's success and the users' needs.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I solicited feedback from users to ensure that I was on the right track and made any necessary adjustments. By following this process, I was able to develop an MVP that was both functional and met the needs of the project and its users.</p>
                <p>Finally, I curated my findings and work, ensuring that everything was clearly documented and presented in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format.</p>
